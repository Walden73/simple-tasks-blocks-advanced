**Simple tasks blocks** is a standalone task manager for Obsidian that lives in your sidebar. It offers a unique dual-storage system (local vault or shared JSON file) for seamless cross-vault synchronization, featuring intuitive category blocks, recurring tasks, and full multilingual support.

## The power of two modes

The core strength of this plugin is its flexibility in how your data is stored:

* **Local mode**: Tasks are stored within your current vault settings. Perfect for private, vault-specific organization.
* **Shared mode (Cross-vault sync)**: Link the plugin to an external JSON file anywhere on your computer. This allows you to **synchronize the same task list across multiple Obsidian vaults** in real-time.

## Key features

* **Standalone management**: Tasks are stored internally or in a shared file; they never clutter your Markdown notes.
* **Categorized and movable blocks**: Group your tasks into clean, rounded blocks. Easily reorder them using the vertical drag handle.
* **Optional due dates and Advanced recurrence**: Set up daily, weekly, monthly, or custom intervals with the ability to skip occurrences or set end dates.
* **Task scratchpad**: Each task has its own dedicated note area for detailed information, accessible via a pop-up window.
* **Smart sorting & Visual alerts**: Tasks are sorted chronologically. Overdue tasks and tasks due today are automatically highlighted.
* **Multilingual support**: Fully localized in English, French, Italian, Spanish, and German.
* **Highly customizable**:
    * Change block colors via a right-click menu.
    * Duplicate tasks within a block.
    * Configure date formats (DD-MM-YYYY or YYYY-MM-DD).
    * Adjust the number of future recurring dates displayed (up to 15).
